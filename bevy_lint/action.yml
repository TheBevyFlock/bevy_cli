  Installs the Bevy linter and its required toolchain.

  This action currently uses Rustup to install the required toolchain components, and it uses
  `cargo install` to install the linter itself. The linter will be installed to `~/.cargo/bin` and
  will be available through the `PATH` by default.

  Note that this currently will override the default Rustup toolchain to nightly. You can fix this
  by calling `rustup default` after this action is run.
