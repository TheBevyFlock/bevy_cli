name: Install `bevy_lint`
author: BD103
description: |
  Installs the Bevy linter and its required toolchain.

  This action currently uses Rustup to install the required toolchain components, and it uses
  `cargo install` to install the linter itself. The linter will be installed to `~/.cargo/bin` and
  will be available through the `PATH` by default.

  Note that this currently will override the default Rustup toolchain to nightly. You can fix this
  by calling `rustup default` after this action is run.
inputs:
  cache:
    description: |
      If set to `true`, this action will cache the built `bevy_lint` executable and reuse it on
      subsequent runs, which can speed up the runtime. This defaults to `false`.
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  save-cache-if:
    description: |
      When caching is enabled, this configures whether a freshly built `bevy_lint` will be saved as
      a new cache. When caching is disabled, this does nothing. This defaults to `true`.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
outputs:
  cache-hit:
    description: |
      A string indicating whether an existing cached `bevy_lint` was used. This will be 'true' if a
      cache was used and '' (an empty string) if a cache was not. If caching is disabled, this will
      always be an empty string.
    # Technically `cache-hit` could be 'false' if a fallback key was used instead of the primary
    # key, but we don't use fallback keys, so that shouldn't happen.
