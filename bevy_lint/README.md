## Installation

`bevy_lint` depends on a pinned nightly version of Rust with the `rustc-dev` Rustup component. This is because `bevy_lint` uses [internal `rustc` crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/) that can only be imported with the permanently-unstable [`rustc_private` feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/rustc-private.html). You can refer to the [compatibility table](#compatibility) to see which version of the linter requires which toolchain.

You can install the toolchain with:

```bash
rustup toolchain install $TOOLCHAIN_VERSION \
    --component rustc-dev \
    --component llvm-tools-preview
```

For example, you would replace `$TOOLCHAIN_VERSION` with `nightly-2024-11-14` if you were installing `bevy_lint` v0.1.0, based on the [compatibility table](#compatibility). Please be aware that you must keep this toolchain installed for `bevy_lint` to function[^keep-toolchain-installed].

[^keep-toolchain-installed]: `bevy_lint` imports internal `rustc` libraries in order to hook into the compiler process. These crates are stored in a [dynamic library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker) that is installed with the `rustc-dev` component and loaded by `bevy_lint` at runtime. Uninstalling the nightly toolchain would remove this dynamic library, causing `bevy_lint` to fail.

Once you have the toolchain installed, you can compile and install `bevy_lint` through `cargo`:

```bash
rustup run $TOOLCHAIN_VERSION cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli.git \
    --tag $TAG \
    --locked \
    bevy_lint
```

Make sure to replace `$TOOLCHAIN_VERSION` and `$TAG` in the above command. The tag for a specific release can be found in the [releases tab](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli/releases). For example, the tag for v0.1.0 is `lint-v0.1.0`.

## Getting Started

`bevy_lint` has the same API as the `cargo check` command:

```bash
bevy_lint --help
```

If you have the [Bevy CLI](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli) installed, the linter is also available through the `lint` subcommand:

```bash
bevy lint --help
```
