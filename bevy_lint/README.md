## Installation

`bevy_lint` depends on a pinned nightly version of Rust with the `rustc-dev` Rustup component. This is because `bevy_lint` uses [internal `rustc` crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/) that can only be imported with the permanently-unstable [`rustc_private` feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/rustc-private.html). You can refer to the [compatibility table](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/linter/compatibility.html) to see which version of the linter requires which toolchain.

You can install the toolchain required for the latest release with:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly-2025-06-26 \
    --component rustc-dev \
    --component llvm-tools-preview
```

If you are installing a different version of the linter, you may need to install a different nightly toolchain as specified by the [compatibility table](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/linter/compatibility.html). Please be aware that you must keep this toolchain installed for `bevy_lint` to function[^keep-toolchain-installed].

[^keep-toolchain-installed]: `bevy_lint` imports internal `rustc` libraries in order to hook into the compiler process. These crates are stored in a [dynamic library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker) that is installed with the `rustc-dev` component and loaded by `bevy_lint` at runtime. Uninstalling the nightly toolchain would remove this dynamic library, causing `bevy_lint` to fail.

Once you have the toolchain installed, you can compile and install `bevy_lint` through `cargo`:

```sh
rustup run nightly-2025-06-26 cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli.git \
    --tag lint-v0.4.0 \
    --locked \
    bevy_lint
```

If you're installing a different version of the linter, you may need to switch the toolchain and tag in the above command.

## Getting Started

`bevy_lint` has the same API as the `cargo check` command:

```sh
bevy_lint --help
```

If you have the [prototype Bevy CLI](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/cli/index.html) installed, the linter is also available through the `lint` subcommand:

```sh
bevy lint --help
```
