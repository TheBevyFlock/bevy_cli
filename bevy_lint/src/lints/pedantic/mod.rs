//! Lints that make the linter a nit-picky perfectionist.
//!
//! Unlike other lint groups, pedantic lints have limited value and may not always apply. Be sure
//! to read the motivation behind each lint in this category before enabling them, and expect to
//! liberally apply `#[allow(...)]` attributes throughout your code if you do use them.
//!
//! These lints are **allow** by default.
