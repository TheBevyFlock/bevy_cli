# Migration Guide

Occasionally changes are made to the **Bevy CLI** that may break existing projects, or majorly change how it is intended to be used. This document provides a guide recommending how to upgrade your existing project to a newer version of the CLI.

To actually install the new version of the CLI, please see [the docs] and [the releases page]. Note that some changes listed here are optional (and will be explicitly marked as such). If you ever run into issues while upgrading, please feel free to [submit an issue].

[the docs]: https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/cli/index.html
[the releases page]: https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli/releases
[submit an issue]: https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli/issues

> **Note**
>
> This document is empty for now, and will be until v0.2.0 of the CLI is released with actual breaking changes. Check back later :)
