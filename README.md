## Installation

<!-- Please keep this section synchronized with the `mdbook` docs. -->

As the CLI is currently an unofficial tool, it is not yet published to <https://crates.io>. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli), however.

You may compile the latest version of the CLI from scratch using `cargo install`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli --tag cli-v0.1.0-alpha.2 --locked bevy_cli
```

<details>
    <summary><strong>Precompiled Binaries</strong></summary>

The CLI is precompiled for Linux, Windows, and macOS. You may install the latest precompiled binary using [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```sh
cargo binstall --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli --version 0.1.0-alpha.2 --locked bevy_cli
```

You can manually download the precompiled binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli/releases).

### Bleeding Edge

> **Here be dragons! 🐉**
>
> You may run into bugs when using the unstable version of the CLI. You've been warned, and have fun! :)

If you want to try out the newest unstable features, you may install the CLI from the [`main`](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli/tree/main) branch:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli --branch main --locked bevy_cli
```

## Quick Start

<!-- Please keep this section synchronized with the `mdbook` docs. -->

With the following steps, you can create a new 2D app with Bevy and run it in your browser:

1. Create a new Bevy app using [the 2D template](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d):

    ```sh
    bevy new -t=2d my_bevy_app
    ```

2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```sh
   cd my_bevy_app
   ```

3. Check the code quality with the linter:

    ```sh
    bevy lint
    ```

4. Run the app in the browser:

    ```sh
    bevy run web --open
    ```
