# Bevy CLI

A prototype [Bevy] CLI tool intended to streamline common tasks when working on projects. Please see the [initial scope document] and [original issue] for history and motivation. The CLI's current features include:

- Project generation from a template
- [A custom, Bevy-specific linter](bevy_lint/README.md)
- Out-of-the-box support for bundling projects into WebAssembly
- An HTTP server for testing these WASM bundles

If you need assistance or want to help, reach out to the [`bevy_cli` working group channel] in the [Bevy Discord].
