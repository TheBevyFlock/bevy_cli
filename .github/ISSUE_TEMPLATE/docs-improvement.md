## How can the CLI or linter's documentation be improved?

Provide a link to the documentation and describe how it could be improved. In what ways is it incomplete, incorrect, or misleading?

If you have suggestions on exactly what the new docs should say, feel free to include them here. Alternatively, make the changes yourself and create a pull request instead.
