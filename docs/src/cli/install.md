# Installation

<!-- Please keep this section synchronized with the `README.md`. -->

At this point, the CLI is not published on <https://crates.io> and needs to be installed via Git:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli --locked bevy_cli
```

The **linter** is not included with the CLI, and will need to be installed separately if you wish to use it. Please refer to its [installation page](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/api/bevy_lint) for more information!
