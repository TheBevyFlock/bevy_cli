# Installation

<!-- Please keep this section synchronized with the `README.md`. -->

As the CLI is currently an unofficial tool, it is not yet published to <https://crates.io>. It is available [on Github](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli), however.

You may compile the latest version of the CLI from scratch using `cargo install`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli --tag cli-v0.1.0-alpha.2 --locked bevy_cli
```

<details>
    <summary><strong>Precompiled Binaries</strong></summary>

The CLI is precompiled for Linux, Windows, and macOS. You may install the latest precompiled binary using [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```sh
cargo binstall --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli --version 0.1.0-alpha.2 --locked bevy_cli
```

You can manually download the precompiled binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli/releases).

## Bleeding Edge

**Here be dragons! üêâ**

You may run into bugs when using the unstable version of the CLI. You've been warned, and have fun! :)
