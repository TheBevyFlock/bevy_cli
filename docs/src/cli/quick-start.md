With the following steps, you can create a new 2D app with Bevy and run it in your browser:

1. Create a new Bevy app using [the 2D template](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d):

    ```sh
    bevy new -t=2d my_bevy_app
    ```

2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```sh
   cd my_bevy_app
   ```

3. Check the code quality with the linter:

    ```sh
    bevy lint
    ```

4. Run the app in the browser:

    ```sh
    bevy run web --open
    ```
