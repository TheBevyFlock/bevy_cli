# Introduction

This is the combined documentation for the **Bevy CLI** and **linter** projects, tools designed to improve the experience developing apps using the [Bevy game engine]. To get started, take a look about the about pages for one of the tools:

- [**Bevy CLI**](cli/index.md)
- [**Bevy Linter**](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/api/bevy_lint/)

[Bevy game engine]: https://bevyengine.org

This is an unofficial community project, hacked upon by the [Bevy CLI working group] until it is eventually upstreamed into the main [Bevy Engine organization]. Pardon our rough edges, and please consider [submitting an issue] or [reaching out in the Bevy Discord] if you run into trouble!
