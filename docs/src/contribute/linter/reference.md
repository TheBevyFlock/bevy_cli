# Reference

> _Reference guides are **technical descriptions** of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is **information-oriented**._
>
> Reference material contains _propositional_ or _theoretical_ knowledge that a user looks to in their _work_.
>
> The only purpose of a reference guide is to describe, as succinctly as possible, and in an orderly way. Whereas the content of tutorials and how-to guides are led by needs of the user, reference material is led by the product it describes.
