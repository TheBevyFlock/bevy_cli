# How-To

> _How-to guides are **directions** that guide the reader through a problem or towards a result. How-to guides are **goal-oriented**._
>
> A how-to guide helps the user get something done, correctly and safely; it guides the user’s _action_.
>
> It's concerned with _work_ - navigating from one side to the other of a real-world problem-field.
