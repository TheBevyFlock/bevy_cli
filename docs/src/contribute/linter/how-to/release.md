# Release `bevy_lint`

## Kick-off Pull Request

1. Review the changelog (`bevy_lint/CHANGELOG.md`) and ensure that all notable changes have been documented.
2. Replace `Unreleased` heading with the version with the format `vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. Update the `**All Changes**` link to compare from `main` to the new tag `lint-vX.Y.Z`. (E.g. `lint-v0.1.0...main` to `lint-v0.1.0...lint-v0.2.0`.)
4. Review the migration guide (`bevy_lint/MIGRATION.md`) and ensure all breaking / significant changes from the previous version are documented.
5. Remove the `-dev` suffix from the version in `Cargo.toml` and the compatibility table in `bevy_lint/README.md`.
    - Please ensure that `Cargo.lock` also updates!
6. Use `grep` to replace most instances of the previous linter version and toolchain with the new ones in the `docs` folder and `README.md`.
    - Be careful not to change the wrong portions of the changelog, migration guide, and compatibility table.
7. Update the tags in the [Github Actions docs](../../../linter/github-actions.md#latest-release) to the latest release.
8. Commit all of these changes and open a pull request.
9. Merge the PR once a core Bevy maintainer approves it with no outstanding issues from other contributors.
    - This starts the release process, enacting a freeze on all other changes until the release has finished. While maintainers need to be aware of this so they do not merge PRs during this time, the release process should take less than an hour, so it's unlikely to ever be an issue.
