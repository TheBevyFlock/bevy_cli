# Installation

## CLI

The CLI supports automatically installing the latest released version of the linter if you do not have it installed already. Make sure you [have the CLI first](../cli/install.md), then simply run the `lint` subcommand:

```sh
bevy lint
```

The CLI will prompt you if you wish to install the linter. Note that it will assume you are using Rustup, and if that isn't the case you should [install the linter manually instead](#manual-without-rustup). Type `y` and press enter to accept:

```
warning: failed to run bevy_lint, trying to find automatic fix...
`bevy_lint` is missing, should I install it for you? [y/n]
```

If you want to auto-confirm the prompt, you may pass `--yes` to the command. Note that if you are installing the linter in CI, you may wish to use the [dedicated Github Action instead](github-actions.md):

```sh
bevy lint --yes
```

## Manual with Rustup

`bevy_lint` requires a specific nightly Rust toolchain with the `rustc-dev` and `llvm-tools-preview` components. You can install the toolchain required for the latest release with:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly-2025-06-26 \
    --component rustc-dev \
    --component llvm-tools-preview
```

If you are installing a different version of the linter, you may need to install a different nightly toolchain as specified by the [compatibility table](compatibility.md). Please be aware that you must keep this toolchain installed for `bevy_lint` to function[^keep-toolchain-installed].

[^keep-toolchain-installed]: `bevy_lint` imports internal `rustc` libraries in order to hook into the compiler process. These crates are stored in a [dynamic library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker) that is loaded by `bevy_lint` at runtime. Uninstalling the nightly toolchain would remove this dynamic library, causing `bevy_lint` to fail.

Once you have the toolchain installed, you can compile and install `bevy_lint` through Cargo:

```sh
rustup run nightly-2025-06-26 cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli.git \
    --tag lint-v0.3.0 \
    --locked \
    bevy_lint
```

If you're installing a different version of the linter, you may need to switch the toolchain and tag in the above command.

## Manual without Rustup

It is possible to use the linter without Rustup, however it requires some extra steps. First, you'll need to install the required nightly Rust toolchain (check the [compatibility table](compatibility.md)) through some other means. If you're using Nix, for example, you would use a [Rust overlay](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Rust#Unofficial_overlays) to do this. Make sure to also install the `rustc-dev` and `llvm-tools-preview` components for the toolchain.

Once you've installed the toolchain and components, use that toolchain's `cargo` to build the linter:

```sh
my-toolchain/bin/cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli.git \
    --tag lint-v0.3.0 \
    --locked \
    bevy_lint
```

Next, you'll need to note down the absolute path the toolchain was installed at. You can easily find it by running:

```sh
my-toolchain/bin/rustc --print sysroot
```

Finally, you will need to set the [`BEVY_LINT_SYSROOT` environmental variable](environmental-variables.md#bevy_lint_sysroot) any time you run `bevy_lint`. The easiest way to do this on Unix-based systems is to set it in a startup script like `.bashrc` or `.profile`:

```sh
export BEVY_LINT_SYSROOT=/absolute/path/to/sysroot
```

## Uninstall

If you wish to uninstall the linter at any time, you may use Cargo to do so:

```sh
cargo uninstall bevy_lint
```

You may also wish to uninstall the Rustup toolchain. The following command will uninstall the toolchain required by the latest version of the linter, but you may need to specify a different toolchain from the [compatibility table](compatibility.md):

```sh
rustup toolchain uninstall 2025-05-14
```

## Upgrade

To upgrade to a newer version of the linter, first [uninstall it](#uninstall) then follow the [CLI](#cli) or [manual](#manual-with-rustup) installation instructions.
